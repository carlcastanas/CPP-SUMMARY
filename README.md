# C++ and Data Structures & Algorithms Cheat Sheet

These are two cheat sheets I put together describing both basic [C++ syntax](C++%20Syntax.md) (mostly C++11) and many common [data structures and algorithms](Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms.md) in C++, which I've used to study for my past interviews at Google, NASA, etc.
